# How Big Is This JSON

I found that I was consistently horrible at estimating the size of various json payloads just by looking at them, so I decided to create something to help me practice getting better at estimating.

## The Exercise

The web UI just generates a random json payload and presents three options to guess how many bytes it would be without whitespace (as it would be in a network response). Then you guess and find out if you were right.

## Running locally

```
npm i && npm start
```
